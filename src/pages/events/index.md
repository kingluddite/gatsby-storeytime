    eventDesc: This year’s event will feature thematically grouped food, beverage, and music all night long. The festivities begin at 5:30pm with live classical music and sophisticated pairings of wine and hors-d’oeuvres. Our silent auction tables will be open for browsing and bidding. Guests are free to roam outdoors, where they will be treated to Brazilian music and enjoy wines from South America and Brazil’s most sought-after appetizers including pão de queijo! Next, guests will be treated to more substantial fare as they enjoy the Storeytime’s musical presentation and live auction.The evening will conclude with an incredible band featuring LA’s top musicians. And the pairings don’t stop either, they just get sweeter.
